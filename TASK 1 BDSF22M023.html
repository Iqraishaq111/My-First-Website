		<h1>HTML The hard way</h1>
   		<p> I stand by my method of teachings HTML the old fashioned- by hand. there is no better vway to truly ubderstand how markup works than typing it out, one tag at a time, then opening your page in a browser. it doews not take long bto develop  a feel for marking up documents properly. </p>
		<p>although you may choose to use a web authoring tool down the line.understanding html will make using your tool easieer and more efficient.</p>
		<p>and for what it is worth ,professional web development tend to mark up content manually because it gives to them better control over the code and allow them to make deliberate decisions about what elemnts are udsed.</p>
